# Cron Hardening

## Service Overview

The `cron` service is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like systems. It allows users and applications to schedule tasks (cron jobs) to run automatically at specified intervals. As it runs with system-level privileges, hardening it reduces the risk of privilege escalation via malicious or misconfigured cron jobs.
