## Installing and Configuring **`OSSEC`**

### What is `OSSEC`

`OSSEC` (Open Source Security) is a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS). It has 3 main features:
    
    - Detects intrusions and malware:
        - Scans for rootkits, trojans and suspicious system changes 
        - Looks at logs for signs of attacks
    
    - File Integrity Monitoring:
        - Watching critical files and directories (/etc, /bin, etc.)
        - Alerts for unexpected changes 
    
    - Real Time Alerts and Active Response:
        - Sends alerts when threats are detected 
        - Automatically blocks attacker similar to Fail2Ban


### Steps 

1. Update system packages and install prerequisites

    ```bash 
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt install libz-dev libssl-dev libpcre2-dev build-essential libsystemd-dev -y
    ```

2. Download and install OSSEC

    - Change to /tmp and get latest OSSEC source: 
    ```bash 
    cd /tmp 
    curl -O https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/archive/3.7.0.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf 3.7.0.tar.gz
    cd ossec-hids-3.7.0
    ```

    - Run install script 
    ```bash 
    sudo ./install.sh
    ```

3. Installation options: 

    | Prompt                                           | Answer                   |

    | What kind of installation do you want?           | **local**                |
    | Where should OSSEC be installed?                 | **/var/ossec** (default) |
    | Do you want e-mail notification?                 | **yes** (add your email) |
    | Do you want to use the integrity check daemon?   | **yes**                  |
    | Do you want to use the rootkit detection engine? | **yes**                  |

4. Start OSSEC: 

    ```bash 
    sudo /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control start
    ```

5. Configure e-mail alerts

    - Edit the config
        ```bash 
        sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
        ```
    
    - Find email section 
        ```bash 
        <global>
            <email_notification>no</email_notification>
        </global>
        ```
    
    - Change to
        ```bash 
        <global>

        ```
    
    - Save and restart
        ```bash 
        sudo /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart
        ``` 
    
6. Test setup 
    
    - Run manual scan 
        ```bash 
        sudo /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart
        sudo tail -f /var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.log
        ```

7. Enable OSSEC on boot

    ```bash 
    sudo systemctl enable ossec
